## Selected Project: Interactive Visualisation for Trustful Service-Aware Network

**Supervisor(s):** Sandro Rodriguez Garzon, Hai Dinh-Tuan, Carlo Segat, Sanjeet Raj Pandey
A Service-Aware Network (SAN) is a framework that enables the network to adapt to the dynamic requirements of various cloud applications. It provides fine-grained networking and computing policies based on service types. In such an environment, trustful communication among components is crucial for improving the network's reliability and performance by avoiding malicious or faulty nodes that could disrupt service delivery.

In this project, we aim to provide an interactive visualization front-end for SANs, offering two distinct views:

1. The Global View provides a overview at the SAN with its components, enabling users to dynamically attach or detach network components from the network.

2. The Individual View provides a detailed look into each component's specificsâ€”such as connections, roles, and identities. It also elaborates on the unique roles that each component plays in the network, whether as a client, service provider, or service repository.
