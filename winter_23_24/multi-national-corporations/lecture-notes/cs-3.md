# Competitive Strategies in Commodity Oligopolies

## Part 3: Introduction to Game Theory

Game: Situation in which players make strategic decisions that take into account each other's actions and responses

Players: All the relevant participants in the game. Games usually have at least two players. If there is any randomness in the game, it is represented by an extra player ("Nature")

Payoff: Numbers that represent the net value to players of obtaining a particular outcome. Players are trying to maximize their payoffs. If the players are trying to maximize something other than profit, for example, the payoffs must be adjusted accordingly

Strategy: Rule or plan of action for playing the game. A single strategy represents a complete set of contingent instructions for what actions to take under what circumstances

Optimal strategy: Strategy that maximizes a player's expected payoff (assumption: rational players)

Cooperative game: Game in which participants can negotiate binding contracts that allow them to plan joint strategies

Constant sum game: Game in which the sum of the payoffs of the players is independent of the outcome of the game

Noncooperative game: Game in which negotiation and enforcement of binding contracts are not possible

Nonconstant sum game: Game in which the sum of the payoffs of the players will depend on the outcome of the game

Payoff matrix is the strategic form of the game

### Type of games

1. Games with dominant strategies

2. Coordination games

- A Schelling point (or focal point) is a solution that people will tend to use in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special or relevant to them
- Maximin strategy: Strategy that maximizes the minimum gain that can be earned

### Equilibrium concepts

Dominant strategies
• I'm doing the best I can no matter what you do
• You're doing the best you can no matter what I do

Nash equilibrium
• I'm doing the best I can given what you are doing
• You're doing the best you can given what I am doing

Pareto efficiency
• I cannot do better without making you worse off
• You cannot do better without making me worse off
