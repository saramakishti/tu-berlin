## Introduction & the practice of MNC: Cahora Bassa

During the first introductory lecture, the professor explained the course structure, regulations, and deadlines regarding student presentations and exam registration. He went into detail on the syllabus and what to expect from the course. In order to get a feel for what to expect from the course, we discussed the case of Cahora Bassa Dam.

Located on South-East Africa, in Mozambique, Cahora Bassa Dam is one of the two major dams on the Zambezi river. The construction of this damn brought much political debate. It was finished on December 1974 although the construction was started much earlier in 1969.

### Background

In 1969, Mozambique was still a ‘colony’ controlled by the fascist Portuguese regime. The country was undergoing a civil war where extremist left groups were gathering support and striving for the independence of the country. Although the dam was built by a \***\*consortium\*\*** of Portuguese, German, British, and South African companies, the emphasis is put into Siemens: a global (MNC) German corporation which was approached by the Portuguese government before the official call for tenders.

### Why was this important?

A MNC such as Siemens was involved in a rather risky business affair with the Portuguese government (still a NATO member) by taking up the construction in a country that was plagued by civil war and instability. Despite the backlash, Siemens went ahead with the project construction.

### Stakeholders

- Mozambique locals that were displaced and affected by the construction site of the dam
- Siemens as a corporation for being directly involved in the construction project
- German government for backing the project and Siemens
- Portuguese government which seeks to retain control over the territory of Mozambique
- Mozambique left-wing groups who were the main actors on the ongoing civil war and disagreeing with the dam construction (but changing their minds after it was finished)

### Outcome

Did Siemens act right as a MNC for pursuing the project and not overstepping their influence on the political climate of Mozambique?

What are the effects of the dam construction today?

Who owns the dam itself?

Who was working on the dam construction - did Siemens manage to create jobs for the local people or was the workforce ‘imported’ from Germany?

and so on…

What would you do if you were in Siemens place at that time? Would you go ahead with the dam construction?
