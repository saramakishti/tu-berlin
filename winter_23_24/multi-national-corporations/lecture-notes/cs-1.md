# Competitive Strategies in Commodity Oligopolies

## Part 1: Theories of oligopolistic competition

### Perfectly competitive markets

**Assumptions:**

1. Price taking

- Many firms compete in the market and face many direct competitors
- Each firm sells a small portion of total market output, so its decisions have no impact on market price
- **Each firm takes the market price as given**

2. Product homogeneity

- Firms produce identical or nearly identical products
- Products are perfectly substitutable, therefore no firm can raise the price of its product without losing all or most of it business
- **Ensure there is single market price, consistent with supply-demand analysis**

3. Free entry and exit

- No special costs that make it difficult for a new firm to enter the market, or to exit it
- Buyers can switch suppliers and suppliers can easily enter or exit a market
- **Competition is effective**

In perfectly competitive markets, the demand and supply curve intersect at the **equilibrium or market price P0 and quantity Q0**.

**Market mechanism** is the tendency in a free market for the price to change until the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal:

- **Surplus:** If the quantity supplied is larger than quantity demanded, the price will fall, increasing demand and lowering supply.

- **Shortage:** If the quantity supplied is lower than quantity demanded, the price will increase, lowering demand and increasing supply.

**Profit maximization by a firm:** A firm will set prices and output level with the objective to maximize its profits.

> π(q) = R(q) – C(q)

> where profit π is the difference between total revenue R (price of the product P times volume sold q) and total cost C (which will also depend on the total output q)

A firm chooses output q\*, so that the difference between revenue R and cost C is **maximized.** At that output, **marginal revenue (the slope of the revenue curve)** and **marginal cost (the slope of the cost curve)** are **equal:**

Slope of revenue curve: dπ / dq = 0
Slope of cost curve: dR / dq - dC / dq = 0

> MR(q) = MC (c)

In a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price taker - therefore the demand curve d is a **horizontal line.**

This demand curve is both its average revenue curve and its marginal revenue curve.

In a perfectly competitive market, the firm should choose its output so that **marginal cost equals price:**

> MC(q) = MR = P

ATC (Average Total Cost) are below MC (Marginal Cost) at the equilibrium q\* so the firm will earn a profit.

### Monopolistically Competitive Market

**Characteristics:**

1. Firms compete by selling **differentiated products** that are highly substitutable but not perfect substitutes.
2. There is free entry and exit to the market.
3. Firms face **downward sloping demand curves and downard sloping marginal revenue curves.**

**Profit maximization:**

- **Profit maximizing output Q** is found at the intersection of the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves.
- In **the short run**, the firm will earn a profit because corresponding Price (P) exceeds Average Cost (AC).
- In **the long run**, the profits of this firm will **attract new firms** with competing brands - making the firms's **market share fall** and its demand curve shifts downard.
- In the long run equilibrium, **price equals average cost**, so the firm will earn zero profit even though it has monopoly power.

**Sources of inefficiency:**

1. In monopolistic competition, **equilibrium price exceeds marginal cost.** The value to consumers of additional units of output exceeds the cost of producing these units.
2. Output is **below that which minimizes average cost.**

BUT

1. Monopoly power is small.
2. Any inefficiency must be balanced against a benefit in these markets which is **product diversity.**

### Oligopoly

**Defined:**

A market in which only a few firms account for most or all of total sales.

**Characteristics:**

1. Products may or may not be differentiated
2. Some or all firms earn substantial profits over the long run because barriers to entry make it difficult or impossible for new firms to enter

**Sources of barriers of entry:**

1. Natural barriers (scale economies, patents, reputation, accessing important resources)
2. Strategic actions that deter entry (overcapacities, price wars)

**Challenges:**

Only a few firms are competing, therefore each firm must carefully consider how its actions will affect rivals and how rivals will react.

**Equilibrium**

_Perfectly competitve and monopolistically competitive:_

- Each firm can take price or market demand as given and largely ignore competitors.
- A market is in equilibrium when firms are doing the best they can and have no reason to change their price or output.

_Oligopolistic market:_

- A firm sets price or output based on strategic considerations regarding the behavior of its competitors.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** Each firm is doing the best it can given what its competitors are doing.

### Models of oligopolistic competition

1. Cournot Model

**Model:**

1. Two firms producing homogeneous products (commodity duopoly)
2. Each firm must decide **how much to produce** and the firms **take decisions at the same time**

**Solution:**

Each firm treats the output level of its competitor as fixed when deciding how much to produce

**Firm 1 Output decision:**

- Profit maximizing output depends on how much it thinks Firm 2 will produce
- Depending on Firm 2's expected output, the demand curve D for Firm 1 will be different
- The corresponding MR curve will intersect with MC curve at **different points of optimal output**
- **Reaction curve of Firm 1:** output of firm 1 is a function of how much firm 2 will produce
- **Reaction curve of Firm 2:** output of firm 2 is a function of how much firm 1 will produce

**Cournot Equilibrium:** intersection of two reaction curves - each firm correctly assumes the amount that its competitor will produce and thereby maximizes its own profit.

**Is Cournot EQ a Nash EQ?**

**Yes**, because each firm is producing an amount that maximizes its profit, given what its competitor is producing, so neither would want to change its output.

**Where to apply it?**

- Industry composed of roughly similar firms, none of which has a strong leadership position
- Industry in equilibrium because then neither firm has an incentive to change its output
- Examples: steel, paper, energy

2. Stackelberg Model: First mover advantage

**Model:**

1. Two firms producing homogeneous products (commodity duopoly)
2. Each firm must decide **how much to produce** and the first to set its output has the advantage

**Solution:**

1. Firm 1 set its output first and then Firm 2 after observing Firm 1's output, makes its output decision.
2. In setting output, Firm 1 must consider how Firm 2 will react.

**Conclusion after finding profit maximization quantities:**

1. Going first gave Firm 1 a competitive advantage - it produces much more than Firm 2 and makes more profit.
2. Announcing first creates the advantage - unless your competitor views getting 'even' more important than profit, it would be irrational to produce a large amount.

**Where to apply it?**

- Industry dominated by one large firm that usually takes the lead in pricing or innovation
- Industry with frequent output decisions (also changing leadership)
- Examples: IBM in mainframe computers, Maersk Line in container shipping

2. Bertrand Model: Price competition

**Model:**

1. Two firms producing homogeneous products (commodity duopoly)
2. Each firm must decide **how much to set the price** and the firms **take decisions at the same time**

**Nash Equilibrium in Bertrand Model:**

- P = 30 - Q
- P1 = MC1 = P2 = MC2 = 3
- Q = 27
- Profit 1 = Profit 2 = 0

1. If the two firms charge different prices, the lower-price firm will supply the entire market and the higher-price firm will sell nothing.
2. Is it Nash Equilibrium? **Yes**, neither firm has an incentive to change its price (higher price = no sales, lower price = loss)
3. No other Nash equilibrium because each firm would undercut until a price of $3 is reached.

**Wheree to apply it?**

- No answer to the question: What share of sales goes to each player if both set the same price?
- When firms produce a homogeneous good, it is more natural to compete by setting quantities rather than prices.
