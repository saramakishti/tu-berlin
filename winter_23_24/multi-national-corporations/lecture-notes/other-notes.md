One option to export goods and services, to support the notion of trade or to invest directly => FDI.
Under which circumstances would a firm change from a market based solution to a direct investment solution?
Countries should specialize, specialization leads to economic advantages. Focus on things we have under control.
Leave other things to others.
The country which has specific raw materials or specific skills and the companies there should focus on this,
produce goods and services and export them to countries where resources are scarce.

US and Germany have very high cost. Germany has to concentrate on knowledge-based services and import the other
resources it doesnt have. Trade is smth which leads to a situation which is better compared to a situation where
each country does everything.

Trade opens the window for considering international activities, but focuses on export.
The advantages of trade & specializiation are highlighted in classic trade theories. Also there is
mercantilism which says you think is better to export things but to restrict imports. In order to support
local business.

Ownership - goes back to Hymer's theory
Find the competitive advantage developed in the home country and then exploited somewhere else
You have to have an advantage, otherwise it doesnt make sense to go abroad because you have to adapt
to other foreign markets. ownership advatnages are related to industrial organization theories. oligopolies
have certain advantages that are companies do not have. Dunning argues that we also have to consider the specific
country conditions, see if other markets can provide cost advantages. If I can exploit it, it makes sense to
go abroad. Internalization -> if we could exploit competitive advantage and location, and do exports no need
for FDI. Need reason because they could also give licensing. If the knowledge cannot be transferred this licensing
or the transfer of knowledge creates additional problem

how successful internalization activities are?
one empirical fact shows that on average multinational firms in these host markets have a pretty good
return on their equity. on average they are quite profitable. doesnt necessarily mean that these money goes back
to shareholders, more often it is reinvested in the country to improve the market position.
With the covid crisis, local context became more important against coordinating things internationally
firms used these years to strength their bases
indication that yes, on average mnc are successful. on the other hand, S-curve concept argues that over the
course of time, it can assumed that at least in the beginning when you start going international, it can be a
risky endeavour and not be profitable. once you have learned, and understood the other market, the profitability
rate goes up and companies benefit from fdi investments. The profit then flattens again and the profits can not
go any higher. measuring the success of mnc is very challenging.

economic geography - local clusters are relevant and firms can use this clusters to develop strength which can then
be exploited to other countries. headquarters in sillicon valley are so strong, they can exploit in other countries
