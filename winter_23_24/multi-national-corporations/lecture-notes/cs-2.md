# Competitive Strategies in Commodity Oligopolies

## Part 2: Typology of strategies in commodity oligopolies

### Phases of a product lifecycle

a. Phase I: Market development

- Competing technologies
- Consumer embrace
- Few competitors

b. Phase II: Market growth

- Technology standardization
- Strong demand growth
- New entries

c. Phase III: Market maturity

- Product standardization
- Consumer indifference
- Consolidation

Nowadays, product lifecycle phases are shortening and commoditization changes the playing field:

1. Increasing standartization

- Products received as interchangable (no brand value)
- Few parameters drive purchasing decision

2. High price elasticity

- Customers react strongly to price differences

3. Low switching costs

- Low actual costs
- Low perceived risk of switching

4. Competitive industry structure

- Rule of 3 and 4 structure
- Established dominant business model

### Paper Industry

An intense competition will only leave efficient market players where:

- all players with fairly same cost level
- inefficient player exit the market or become takeover candidates
- efficiency gains of the industry are passed on to customers

### Steel Industry

Barriers to exit may lead to persistent overcapacities where:

- exit costs resulting from recultivation commitments, personnel reduction etc.
- high political pressure to retain existing structures
- temporary capacity reduction sometimes is expensive and risky

### Commoditization Overview

#### Negative impacts for US Retail industry

- Slowing growth
- Lower margins
- Industry Consolidation

#### But some continue to flourish - outsized returns available even in commoditizing industries

### Patterns of strategic behaviour

1. Evasion: Changing the rules of the game

- Flexibilization of the business model (Zara)

  - Shortened product lifecycle from 52 weeks to 21 days
  - 50% in-house production
  - 90% of production in Europe (not Asia)
  - Integration of IT and logistics from design through delivery
  - Hardly any discounts, no frequent sales
  - Change of models biweekly, rapid imitation instead of innovation
  - Outperforming the industry

- Rediscovering the product, commodity branding (Starbucks)

  - Branding of a commodity
  - Willingness to destroy customer base
  - Difficult to pursue by current 'brands'

- Changing paradigms (low-cost carriers)

  - Changed structure of airline's fleet
  - Hub-and-spokes model
  - Current 'brands' cannot respond due to legacy assets

Can incumbents change the rules of the game? The case of Progressive Car Insurance

Starting point:

- Top 10 US insurance company: 4th largest player with 8% share in fragmented auto market
- Increasing commoditization of auto insurance marketplace: competing on prices with undifferentiated risk measurements

Strategic actions:

- Introduced new product: capability to optimize pricing via real-time data
- Enabled more accurate customer segmentation in order to tailor discounts

Results:

- Improved retention
- Increased sales volume
- Improved loss ratio of customer base

2. Hardball: Discipline through deterrence

- Deterrence by commitment to fighting (The conquest of Mexico by Spain in 1519)

  - Cortés ordered that all ships be burnt (except one), which made retreat impossible and served as a signal to Moctezuma that resistance would lead to fighting, not retreat.
  - Moctezuma decided not to fight, but to provide Cortés and the Spanish Crown with huge amounts of gold every year.

- Deterrence by credible commitment (Boeing vs Airbus)

  - Airbus sold the planes before building them and would pay large fees if not delivering
  - Clear and firm commitment due to significant financial consequences
  - Competitor is “forced” to adopt a specific strategy

- Keeping each other at bay (Cement companies)

  - Competitors meet in the market, sometimes with different relative strengths
  - The major players thus have possibilities to effectively impose sanctions

- Destroying competitors (Walmart)

  - Power struggle on the basis of prices or capacities with the aim of displacing competitors
  - Clarity about the opponents’ staying power and/or limits

3. Cooperation: Optimizing joint efforts

- Harmonius pricing (Prime Rate & AAA Corporate Bond Yields)

  - Consistency of pricing for several periods
  - Activities and deviations easy to observe
  - Tolerating occasional pricing deviations of competitors

- Acceptance of turfs (German electricity providers)

  - Complementary attractiveness of segments
  - Cooperation benefits over several periods
  - Credible retreat of the player giving the signal

- Sustainable capacity management (Glass industry)

  - Orientation of capacity planning at long-term trend
  - Capacity adjustment in weak phases, rather than price wars
  - Stability highly dependent on large players’ “strong nerves”
