## A View on Africa

### Challenges and Opportunities

**Demographics:** Africa's young, tech-savvy population has implications for learning, innovation, and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) strategies.

**Economic Growth:** There's uncertainty about whether African countries' growth will follow other countries or chart unique pathways.

**Global connectivity:** Africa's increasing global FDI and trade participation affect theories related to learning, governance, and Global Value Chains (GVCs).

**Intra-regional linkages:** Despite fragmentation, regional blocks and continent-wide pacts like the African Continental Free Trade Area are developing, influencing IB theories on spillovers and trade.

**Language:** The continent's linguistic diversity informs theories of FDI location choice and trade patterns.

**Ethnic Fragmentation:** Ethnic diversity impacts a range of IB issues, such as social networks and subsidiary management.

**Governance:** Improved governance quality in many countries leads to implications for theories of institutional agency and entrepreneurship.

**Human Capital:** Africa's human capital plays a significant role in its rise, prompting the need for further research in IB on location and ownership advantages.

**Diaspora:** The large and influential African diaspora has implications for theories of human and social capital.

**Informal Economy:** The informal sector's growth impact on IB has been understudied but is increasingly recognized in MNE supply chains and stakeholder relations.
